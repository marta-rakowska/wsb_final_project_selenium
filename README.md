# WSB Merito final project Selenium

## About

This repository contains the first part of my final project for Python programming postgraduate studies at WSB Merito University.
 
The project consists of two parts:
1. Automated tests of the [Generic Shop](https://skleptest.pl) written in Selenium.
1. Automated tests of the [Generic Shop](https://skleptest.pl) website written in Robot Framework.
 
You can find the tests in Robot Framework here.
 
There are ... tests:
